delvj 0.7.6
a cyborg video jockey extension for pure data processing

comprises a set of pure data patches, a web interface 
written in php and a graphical interface using python+glade

-----------------------

This is a set of patches for pure data which allow the generation of videos encompassed to music. Video generation can be tutored by many individuals with web access to the machine through a web interface. It also has a gtk interface for rapid access through local computer

You will need:
	puredata
	pdp-caedes+pidip-caedes+3dp for puredata
	osc external for puredata
	playlist for puredata
	python-glade2
	python-gtk2
	python-xmms (optional)
	python-ttfquery (not in debian, only needed for selecting fonts)

	totem (this is the video thumbnailer for gnome, i don't like this, but haven't yet found a way to generate the video thumnails using lighter programs, please inform me if you know how to do it)
	xine (video previewer, not compulsory)
	possibly mencoder and transcoder for transcoding videos to a good format for pidip.

Let's see what we have here:

debian		scripts for debian packet generation
interfazweb	files for the web interface
parches		the pure data patches
scripts		useful scripts
glade		gtk interface files
sprites		sample images
textos		sample texts

if you install the debian package you'll find all these at /usr/share/delvj/.

To install manually you should copy the interfazweb directory to /var/www/pd or wherever you see fit. Also you will need a directory called /var/www/pd/thumbsvideo (unless you change the php scripts...) with write acces for whoever will generate the thumbnails (by the moment you must use the delpd_thumbnailer.sh script, it's planned for the web interface to do this).

SCRIPTS:
delpd_thumbnailer.sh	generates the video thumbnails
pd-sync*.sh		launches the pure data patches
pd_transcode3.sh	encodes videos to a nice mov format for pidip

BINARIES:
delvj			runs the gtk interface
